## Overview

In the burgeoning field of precision agriculture, managing environmental conditions with granular precision is not just advantageous; it's essential. As we delve into the practice of smarter farming, the spotlight falls on greenhousesâ€”the controlled environments where technology and agriculture converge to yield maximal productivity and efficiency.

This repository introduces a sophisticated LabVIEW simulation designed to automate and regulate the environmental conditions of a greenhouse ecosystem. Embracing the essence of data-driven and responsive farming practices, this simulation is a blueprint for an advanced, smart greenhouse system.

## LabVIEW Simulation

The LabVIEW simulation crafted herein is a testament to the ingenuity of integrating automated systems for environmental control. It meticulously orchestrates the regulation of:

- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Moisture**
- **Light Intensity (LUX Level)**
- **pH Levels**
- **CO2 Levels**
- **Energy Consumption**

These parameters are crucial in maintaining the idyllic balance required for plant growth, offering a canvas for the plants to flourish while ensuring sustainability and judicious resource management.
